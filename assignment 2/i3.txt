PayPal (ticker: PYPL) reported a fourth-quarter profit of $1.11 a share Tuesday, 
narrowly missing forecasts of $1.12 a share. 
Sales of $6.92 billion topped estimates for $6.89 billion.

But PayPal said it expects to earn between $4.60 and $4.75 
a share this fiscal year, below forecasts for $5.25. 
Guidance for revenue growth of 15% to 17% is also lower than its initial 18% forecast.

That guidance has rocked the apple cart. The 25% drop was PayPalâ€™s worst decline on record, 
worse than the 15.8% decline seen on March 16, 2020. 
The stock ended the day around $132, a 52-week low.
